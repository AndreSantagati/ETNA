# Automated Threat Hunting Platform

## Overview

The **Automated Threat Hunting Platform** is an open-source tool designed to help security analysts and blue teams proactively detect and investigate suspicious activity in their environments. By ingesting and analyzing security logs, correlating them with open-source threat intelligence (CTI), and mapping events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, this platform automates the process of threat hunting and provides actionable insights.

## Features

- **Log Ingestion & Parsing:**  
  Supports ingestion of various log formats (CSV, JSON, EVTX, etc.) from endpoints, servers, or SIEM exports.

- **Threat Intelligence Integration:**  
  Integrates with public CTI feeds (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, CISA KEV, Abuse.ch) to enrich log data and hunting rules.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:**  
  Automatically maps log events to relevant MITRE ATT&CK TTPs for context and reporting.

- **Automated Hunting Engine:**  
  Scans logs for suspicious patterns, IOCs, and TTPs, generating alerts and findings.

- **Reporting & Visualization:**  
  Outputs findings in human-readable reports and (optionally) interactive dashboards.

- **Extensible & Modular:**  
  Easily add new log sources, CTI feeds, or detection rules.
